# A few implementation notes:
#
#   1. The input, a collection of solutions, can be a list, iterator,
#      generator, view, etc.
#
#   2. Do not modify the input!  Create a copy with `list(solutions)` if
#      required.
#
#   3. Use `functools.cmp_to_key()` to convert a comparison function to an
#      equivalent key function.
#
#   4. If no key is provided, the objective values are used.  This results
#      in lexicographical ordering when sorting.
